# BookFind

A simple website designed to look like old websites that lets you find books!<br>
You might have to type in the full name of the book, but I made this just for fun, so it's not a complete product, nor will it ever be.<br>
If you just want to find an old book finding website from the 90s, this is the website for you.<br>
3/12/21 Update: I just tested it on internet explorer 4, and it works as long as you force the site to use http. (by using the link below)
